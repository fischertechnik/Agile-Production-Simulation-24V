## Raspberry PI Image

The Raspberry PI image can be found under the following link: https://short.omm.cloud/rpi-v100

### Installation instructions

#### Requirements

- A microSD card (32 GB or larger recommended)
- A microSD card reader (if your computer does not have a built-in SD card slot)
- The Raspberry Pi disk image file
- USBImager software (recommended from https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/)

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Download USBImager:**
   - Visit the official USBImager webpage at https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/
   - Download the version of USBImager compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install USBImager:**
   - USBImager is typically provided as a portable application, meaning no installation is necessary. Simply extract the downloaded archive and run the executable.

3. **Prepare Your microSD Card:**
   - Insert the microSD card into your computer using a card reader.
   - Make sure to back up any important data on the microSD card, as this process will erase all existing data on the card.

4. **Launch USBImager:**
   - Open the USBImager application you downloaded and extracted.

5. **Select the Raspberry Pi Image File:**
   - Click on the "Browse" button to open a file dialog.
   - Navigate to the location of your Raspberry Pi image file and select it.

6. **Select the Destination Drive:**
   - Be very careful at this step to select your microSD card from the list of available drives.
   - Double-check to ensure you've selected the correct drive, as choosing the wrong one could erase data on another device.

7. **Write the Image:**
   - Click the "Write" button to start writing the Raspberry Pi image to the microSD card.
   - Wait for the process to complete. This may take several minutes, depending on the size of the image and the speed of your microSD card.

8. **Safely Eject the microSD Card:**
   - Once the writing process is complete, close USBImager.
   - Eject the microSD card safely from your computer.

9. **Insert the microSD Card into Your Raspberry Pi:**
   - Remove the microSD card from the card reader and insert it into the microSD card slot on your Raspberry Pi.

10. **Power On Your Raspberry Pi:**
    - Connect the power supply to your Raspberry Pi.
    - Your Raspberry Pi should boot from the microSD card you just prepared.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Raspberry Pi Does Not Boot:**
  - Ensure the microSD card is properly inserted.
  - Verify that the Raspberry Pi image file was correctly written to the microSD card.
  - Check if your Raspberry Pi model requires a specific version of the image file.

- **Slow Performance:**
  - Consider using a microSD card with a faster read/write speed.
  - Ensure the Raspberry Pi power supply meets the recommended specifications.

## Content

The PLC project archives of the individual modules are in the `PLC-programs` folder.

The solution to the exercise can be found in the folder `PLC-programs\S7_1200_TIAv18\Exercises`.

The `TXT4.0 programs` folder contains the project files of the 4 different TXTs of the APS.

The `NodeRed` folder contains the flows of NodeRed as a Json file

### TXT4.0

ROBO Pro Coding is required to access the code of the TXTs. This can be found in the Microsoft Store via the search.

Once the program has started, the project files can be imported and changed.

### NodeRed

A NodeRed container is running on the Raspberry PI of the APS. To view the NodeRed flows of the APS, you can connect to the NodeRed via `http://192.168.0.100:1880/`. This requires a LAN or WLAN connection to the APS.

### SPS

TIAv18 is required to access the PLC programs.

As soon as TIAv18 is installed, the project files can be loaded and edited.
