## Content

The PLC project archives of the individual modules are in the `PLC-programs` folder.

The solution to the exercise can be found in the folder `PLC-programs\S7_1200_TIAv18\Exercises`.

The `TXT4.0 programs` folder contains the project files of the 4 different TXTs of the APS.

The `NodeRed` folder contains the flows of NodeRed as a Json file

### TXT4.0

ROBO Pro Coding is required to access the code of the TXTs. This can be found in the Microsoft Store via the search.

Once the program has started, the project files can be imported and changed.

### NodeRed

A NodeRed container is running on the Raspberry PI of the APS. To view the NodeRed flows of the APS, you can connect to the NodeRed via `http://192.168.0.100:1880/`. This requires a LAN or WLAN connection to the APS.

### SPS

TIA is required to access the PLC programs.

If TIA v18 is installed, the project files can be loaded and edited.
